# FileSafe Embed

This is the reusable UI library that is part of the larger FileSafe system. It uses FileSafeJS to build a UI for managing files, integrations, and keys. FileSafe Embed is not meant to be used in isolation, but is instead meant to be embedded into a final wrapper. For example, the Bold Editor and FileSafe Extension Bar use this library.
