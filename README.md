# Filesafe Embed

This is the reusable UI library that is part of the larger Filesafe system. It uses FileSafeJS to build a UI for managing files, integrations, and keys. Filesafe Embed is not meant to be used in isolation, but is instead meant to be embedded into a final wrapper. For example, the Bold Editor and Filesafe Extension Bar use this library.
